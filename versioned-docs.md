# Versioned Documentation

We are starting to run into issues with people trying to use Fairlearn installed from PyPI with the documentation on [our website](https://fairlearn.github.io/).
This is an issue because we have made and are making a number of breaking changes to our API.
The solution to this is to provide versioned documentation, so that users can read the docs associated with the version they have installed.
This is the pattern used by projects such as [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org).
