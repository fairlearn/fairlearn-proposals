# Releases & Compatibility

To date, we have been somewhat cavalier about making breaking changes in Fairlearn.
Although we are currently pre-`v1.0.0` and hence without particular commitments to compatibility (as generally understood - see e.g. the [Semantic Versioning Scheme](https://semver.org/)), we should work to reduce the number of breaking changes we make.

At the time of writing, we are about to release `v0.4.6`, which has some substantial breaking changes in the Metrics area of Fairlearn.
Before it, `v0.4.5` reworked a smaller subset of this functionality.
This is obviously undesirable from a user standpoint - these look like 'patch' level releases, but instead are breaking their code.
